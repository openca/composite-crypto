    		PKIs are used to provide scalability and ease key management. One type of PKIs that is
    		predominant for securing communications and data is based on the X.509 standard.
				Since the security of PKIs, ultimately, depends on the security of the cryptographic
				building blocks that are used for authentication and encryption, the standards
				community made algorithm agility one of the main goals to provide the possibility
				to use different algorithms and potentially upgrade to newly available algorithms
				when needed.

   			In particular, this specification defines how to distribute OCSP responses over DNS
   			and how to define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in certificates.

   			The use of the DNS system to distribute such information is meant to lower the costs of
   			providing revocation services (by leveraging the distributed nature of DNS cache) and
   			increase the availability of revocation information (by providing an additional access
   			method for revocation information retrieval).

			<t>
				With the definition of new algorithms (e.g. more efficient factoring techniques) and
				technologies (e.g., quantum-based computing devices) that might be available in the
				short future, the need to provide an easy-to-deploy and efficient solution capable of
				providing multi-algorithms authentication is paramount.

				<vspace blankLines="1" />

				Today there are no complete or general solutions that allow for the securing PKI deployments
				capable of addressing the envisioned problem that fit in today's trust models. In particular,
				whichever the specific standard or technology is used in a PKI (e.g., X.509, PGP, etc.), no
				deployments currently cover the possibility to use multiple algorithms in a combined fashion
				to further secure the infrastructure in case one (or more) algorithms are deemed compromised.
				Moreover, existing proposals to add support for additional keys (and signatures) in certificates
				focus on the implementation of single algorithms mostly targeting quantum resistant ones.
				This solution differs in that it allows to combine one or more algorithms today (e.g., RSA
				and ECDSA) and provide a path for multi-algorithm agility that can address post-quantum and
				future crpto-algorithm agility needs.

				<vspace blankLines="1" />

				This document defines two new building blocks that can be applied to many environments
				where Public Key authentication is used â€“ i.e., from the generation of certificates that
				are authenticated with multiple signatures (i.e., using multiple keys that may or may not
				use different cryptographic schemes or different number of security bits), to the
				possibility of specifying composite public keys (instead of one) in a certificate (or
				authentication tokens), or even to secure revocation and timestamping information by using
				multiple signatures that use different hashing and signing algorithms.

				The two new building blocks are Composite Signatures and Composite Keys.
			
				<vspace blankLines="1" />

				This document describes the encoding of the new building blocks and their application to
				different X.509 core data structures that are used in PKIs.

		<section anchor="scope" title="Scope Statement">
			<t>
				This document focuses only on the definition of the composite keys
				and composite signatures definitions for X.509 based PKIs. In particular,
				this document defines the encoding rules for the two building blocks and
				their usage in existing X.509 data structures.
